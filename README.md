#Â Darline

Darline is a home-made tailor-made extra light front-end framework.

**WORK IN PROGRESS WORK IN PROGRESS WORK IN PROGRESS**

Here is why it is born:

* get rid of jQuery in my day to day work
* keep control in responsiveness
* avoid repeating some CSS in all projects
* avoid repeating basic JS functions in all projects
* get rid of jQuery in my day to day work (doh)

By essence, Darline doesn't do many things, and never will:

* it doesn't try to fit every needs
* it doesn't support old non standard browsers
* it doesn't use gradients
* it doesn't use shadows
* it doesn't contain cool effects

## Grid

Darline provides a 35 cols grid and a why to easily make a page responsive. See the example in the `example` directory.

## Forms

Darline provides a basic form styling.
